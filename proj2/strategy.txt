strategy
1. delete opponents pieces that connect their pieces
2. move in my own piece to touch my other own pieces
3. dont delete opponents pieces that are on the edge or not touching anything
4. count number of pieces touching, compared to number of total pieces on the board.


- count piles, find max/main pile, if a move moves a piece from a small pile to the main/max pile, give a higher score (5)
