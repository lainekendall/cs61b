H. Balanced Search Trees

1. Give a formula for the exact height of a binary search tree (as you
   implemented in homework 6) as a function of N if we insert N values in
   increasing order.

N because you will always insert the next value to the right of the value you are at, creating a right-leaning tree, ie a linked list of length N. 

2. Give a formula for the exact height of a 2-4 tree in terms of N if 
   we insert N values in increasing order.

the height of a 2-4 tree is always proportional to log base 4 of N, which is proportional to log base 2 of N (our normal logN). The fact that the values are increasing doesn't matter because part of the conditions of a 2-4 tree is that it has to be balanced. (and also can be represented as a red-black tree, which is balanced, and its height is thus logN, if N is number of values).
